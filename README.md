# Hopping master equation
 A bunch of code to simulate charge hopping on toy lattice models, using the master equation approach. All of this code has been directly transplanted from my `percolate_mac` repo. Since all of the code is self-contained and has nothing to do (directly) with percolation theory, Im putting it in its own repo.
